# This is an implementation of [`lbasi`](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) from *Ruslan Spivak* writen in [Stanza Programming Language](http://lbstanza.org/)

## What the heck is Stanza?
Stanza is a new classless programming language that I like so far. It's compiles to native code and it syntax looks like Julia and Python but it not support OOP so
you must know some FP concepts in order to understand the language's most powerful features, that's why I'm forcing myself to write an interpreter with it. If i success
then I could probably do anything with Stanza.

## What about `lbasi`
Well, Ruslan has stopped the development and just reached the charpter 19 so far. My goal is go through *(again)* those chapters and maybe continue the development of the
pascal interpreter but don't expect to see several commits soon because I'm stupid in FP and i need to think and think over and over again until i get the point.

Are you brave enough to learn a FP language? hope you are because it will change your current programmer mind!
